\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

% General introduction
This tutorial helps you learn to use PFunc, short for Parallel Functions, a
lightweight and portable library that provides C and \Cpp{} APIs to express
task parallelism. 
%
PFunc enables programmers to focus on developing parallel algorithms and
specify low-level and high-level tasks to parallelize instead of working with
native threading libraries such as POSIX and Windows threads.
%
Although there are several task libraries, PFunc is unique in that its features
are a strict superset of the features offered by current solutions for task
parallelism.  
%
Specifically, PFunc extends the feature set of current solutions with custom
task scheduling, task priorities and task affinities.
%
In addition, PFunc offers task groups for SPMD-style programming and multiple
task completion notifications for parallel execution of DAGs. 
%
PFunc's extended feature set is geared towards helping knowledgeable users
optimize their application performance.

%
Figure~\ref{fig:life_cycle} depicts the life-cycle of a PFunc
application. 
%
First, the library is initialized. Then, tasks are repeatedly spawned and
executed in parallel.  Finally, the library instance is cleared.
%
This tutorial is organized to reflect the life-cycle of PFunc applications.

The table below gives a brief summary of each section.
