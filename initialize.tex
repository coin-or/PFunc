\caption{Table depicting the three parameters that are needed to initialize 
PFunc's runtime.}
\label{fig:init}
\end{figure}

% Mention that there are two ways of doing things.
Once the appropriate library instance description has been generated, the next
step is to initialize the PFunc runtime. 
%
PFunc's runtime is encapsulated by objects of type \code{taskmgr}; each object
of type \code{taskmgr} encapsulates a task scheduling policy, a number of task
queues into which tasks can be placed, and threads that are attached to these
task queues, which execute the tasks.
%
In fact, the words ``runtime'' and \code{taskmgr} can be used interchangably.
%
Typically, there is one object of type \code{taskmgr} per application run; 
however, 
users can create as many object instances of type \code{taskmgr} as
they deem necessary.
%
For example, if there are two disjoint sets of
tasks that need to be run simultaneously with different scheduling policies, it
is advisable to create two objects of type \code{taskmgr}. 
%
Each such object of
type \code{taskmgr} represents a separate initialized instance of PFunc's
runtime.
%
PFunc further facilitates users who require just one runtime (\code{taskmgr})
per application run by allowing specification of a global object of type
\code{taskmgr} that can be used as an implicit argument in many function calls.
%
To initialize PFunc's runtime, users are required to provide three pieces of
information: number of queues, number of threads per queue and the affinities
of threads to processors (see Figure~\ref{fig:init}).
%
By tweaking these parameters, users are able to choose from a wide variety of
mappings ranging from centralized work-sharing model to the distributed
work-stealing model. 
%
For example, consider the following code that creates an instance of Cilk-style
runtime with four threads and one queue per thread.
%
\begin{lstlisting}
/* Library instance description */
typedef pfunc::generator<cilkS, pfunc::use_default, parallel_foo> my_pfunc;
@\halfline@
int main () {
  unsigned int num_queues = 4;
  const unsigned int num_threads_per_queue[] = {1,1,1,1};
  const unsigned int affinities[4][1] = {{0},{1},{2},{3}};
  @\halfline@
  /* Create a variable of the type taskmgr */
  my_pfunc::taskmgr my_taskmgr (num_queues, num_threads_per_queue, affinities);
  ...
  return 0; /* PFunc runtime is destroyed when my_taskmgr goes out of scope */
}
\end{lstlisting}

\paragraph{Scheduling Model} In the above example, we choose to have 4 task
queues and 1 thread per queue; that is, thread has its own queue. 
%
Since we choose \code{cilkS} scheduling policy, when a thread runs out of work
on its own queue, it ``steals'' work from other task queues; in fact, all four
built-in scheduling policies (\code{cilkS}, \code{prioS}, {lifoS}, and
\code{fifoS}) follow this stealing model.
%
Hence, this model is called the work-stealing model. 
%
At the other end of the spectrum, if had chosen to have a single queue and put
all our threads on it, it would constitute a work-sharing model. 
%
PFunc also allows users to define an $m\times{}n$ model, which would be a
hybrid between the work-stealing and work-sharing models.  
%
The work-stealing model has been proven to be efficient for running
applications that are written in a divide and conquer model. 
%
In such applications, each thread generates ample tasks to keep itself busy and
avoids the contention associated with having a single task queue. 
%
The best scheduling policy for an application is usually found out by
experimenting with different configurations. 
%
With PFunc, this is as simple as just changing the library instance description
and the initialization of the runtime.

\paragraph{Processor Affinities} 
%
In our example, we also specify the processor affinities for each of the
threads; we bound thread 0 to processor 0, thread 1 to processor 1, thread 2 to
processor 2 and thread 3 to processor 3.
%
Processor affinities are currently only supported on Linux platforms. 
%
By default, each thread can be scheduled to run on \textit{any} of the
available processors (cores). 
%
Binding a thread to a particular processor (core) might results in better cache
resuse for applications running on dedicated machines. 
%
However, setting a thread's affinity also prevents it from being scheduled on
other processors (cores). 

\paragraph{How many threads?} 
%
The total number of threads that are created can be calculated by multiplying
the number of queues with the number of threads in each queue. 
%
In our example, we are creating 4 threads in all; these threads are
created in addition to the main user thread that is already running. 
%
As a general rule, it is recommended to have only as many threads running an
application as there are processors (cores). 
%
For example, on a dual core machine, we recommend creating only two threads,
regardless of the configuration that the users set the threads up in (for
example, $2\times{}1$ or $1\times{}2$). 
%
Creating more threads than processors might result in performance degradation
as threads contend for shared computing resources. 
%
Furthermore, each PFunc runtime initialization (i.e., each object of type
\code{taskmgr}) creates its own threads separate from other instances. 
%
So, exercise caution while having more than one library instance running.

\paragraph{What do the threads do?} As soon as PFunc's runtime is initialized,
the task queues and their corresponding threads are created. 
%
Each thread continually checks on the tasks queues (starting with its own) for
tasks to be executed.
%
However, as such continuous checking for tasks to run can deplete compute
resource, PFunc threads check for tasks a pre-specified number of times
($2\times10^{6}$ by default) before ``yielding'' the processor that they are
running on. 
%
Such yielding behavior allows PFunc applications to co-exist with other
applications without completely holding up compute resources. 
%
However, when the number of threads is $\le{}$ to the number of processors
available to run, and the application is being run on a dedicated machine,
users can opt to never yield threads by increasing the number of attempts made
by each thread before yielding. 
%
The higher the number of attempts made by a thread, the quicker the response
time of a task in the task queue of being picked up by the thread and executed. 
%
The code below demonstrates how the maximum attempts can be changed if it is
not to the user's liking. 
%
\begin{lstlisting}
unsigned int num_attempts;
pfunc::taskmgr_max_attempts_get (my_taskmgr, num_attempts);
if (10000 > num_attempts) pfunc::taskmgr_max_attempts_set (my_taskmgr, 10000);
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Initializing in C}
\label{sec:c:init}
%
We now demonstrate how to initialize PFunc when using the C interface. 
%
For ease of understanding, we initialize to the same specification as the
\Cpp{} example above.
%
\begin{lstlisting}
int main () {
  unsigned int num_queues = 4;
  const unsigned int num_threads_per_queue[] = {1,1,1,1};
  const unsigned int affinities[4][1] = {{0},{1},{2},{3}};
  pfunc_cilk_taskmgr_t cilk_tmanager;
  @\halfline@
  /* Initialize a global instance of the library */
  pfunc_cilk_taskmgr_init (&cilk_tmanager, num_queues, num_threads_per_queue, affinities);
  ...
  /* Clear the global instance of the library */
  pfunc_cilk_taskmgr_clear (&cilk_tmanager);
  @\halfline@
  return 0;
}
\end{lstlisting}
%
Immediately, two differences can be seen from the \Cpp{} example. 
%
First, as we are programming in C, PFunc is initialized using a function call
(\func{pfunc_cilk_taskmgr_init} in this case) rather than by constructors.
%
Second, unlike in \Cpp{}, PFunc's runtime needs to be explicitly cleared to
release all the resources allocated by PFunc (using
\func{pfunc_cilk_taskmgr_clear} in this case).

\subsection{Using global runtimes}
%
In most cases, only one object of type \code{taskmgr} (one runtime) is
required. 
%
Under such circumstances, it becomes tedious to explicitly specify the correct
runtime to use when spawning tasks. 
%
To avoid this, PFunc allows users to set up a global runtime and use it as the
default runtime when a specific runtime (object of type \code{taskmgr}) is not
specified in the various PFunc function calls. 
%
In following \Cpp{} code sample, we set up a global runtime and then proceed to
change the number of attempts made by each thread to check for the availability
of a task before yielding control to the thread scheduler.

\begin{lstlisting}
typedef pfunc::generator<cilkS, pfunc::use_default, parallel_foo> my_pfunc;
@\halfline@
int main () {
  unsigned int num_queues = 4;
  const unsigned int num_threads_per_queue[] = {1,1,1,1};
  const unsigned int affinities[4][1] = {{0},{1},{2},{3}};
  unsigned int num_attempts;
@\halfline@
  /* Create a variable of the type taskmgr */
  my_pfunc::taskmgr my_taskmgr (num_queues, num_threads_per_queue, affinities);
@\halfline@
  /* Set up my_taskmgr as the global runtime */
  pfunc::init (my_taskmgr);
@\halfline@
  /* Change the number of attempts if necessary */
  pfunc::taskmgr_max_attempts_get (num_attempts);
  if (10000 > num_attempts) pfunc::taskmgr_max_attempts_set (10000);
@\halfline@
  /* Clear my_taskmgr as the global runtime */
  pfunc::clear ();
@\halfline@
  return 0; /* my_taskmgr is destroyed when my_taskmgr goes out of scope */
}
\end{lstlisting}
%
The global run time is set up by first initializing an object of the type
\code{taskmgr} (\code{my_taskmgr}) as before and then using the function
\func{init} to specify the use of \code{my_taskmgr} as the global runtime. 
%
Corresponding to this, it is necessary to clear the global runtime using the
function \func{clear}. This does not destroy \code{my_taskmgr}, but merely
unsets the use of \code{my_taskmgr} as the global runtime; this is useful when
users want to switch to using a different object of type \code{taskmgr} as the
global runtime. 
%
Finally, we turn our attention to how setting up the global 
runtime simplifies further function calls. 
%
In our case, we have simply omitted the first argument (meant to be
\code{my_taskmgr}) from calls to the functions \func{taskmgr_max_attempts_set}
and \func{taskmgr_max_attempts_get}. 
%
Similarly, once the global runtime has been set up, users can omit the
\code{taskmgr} argument from the function call.

Figure~\ref{fig:c_global} demonstrates the programmatic equivalent of the above
example in C; to set up and clear the global runtime, we have used the
functions \func{pfunc_cilk_init} and \func{pfunc_cilk_clear} respectively. 
%
The one marked difference from the \Cpp{} example is the addition of the
``\code{_gbl}'' suffix to the name of the functions that operate on the global
runtimes. 
%
Such suffixing is necessary because C does not provide function overloading. 
%
For example, in Figure~\ref{fig:c_global}, the local equivalent of the function
\func{pfunc_cilk_taskmgr_max_attempts_set_gbl} would be
\func{pfunc_cilk_taskmgr_max_attempts_set}.
