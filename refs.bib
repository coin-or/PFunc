  abstract =	 "Recently, generic programming becomes of a major
                  interest in several programming paradigms. A
                  recurrent idea to achieve genericity is to abstract
                  computations from their representative data
                  structures. This allows these generic specifications
                  to be instantiated onto a large number of
                  neighboring data structures. Moreover the program
                  can be adapted when the data structures have to
                  evolve. Polytypic programming, adaptive programming
                  and generic attribute grammars are generic
                  programming methods related to this approach. Their
                  comparison leads us to propose a common framework
                  for generic programming: automatic generation of
                  programs that compute morphisms between data
                  structures, and program composition. Thanks to this
                  compositional approach, the complete specialization
                  of generic programs could be advantageously
                  delegated to some powerful and general deforestation
                  method.",

  abstract = {Although the functional programming language Haskell
              has a powerful type class system,
              users frequently run into situations
              where they would like to be able to define or adapt
              instances of type classes
              only \emph{after} the remainder of a component has been produced.
              However, Haskell's type class system
              essentially only allows late binding
              of type class constraints on free type variables,
              and not on uses of type class members
              at variable-free types.
               
              In the current paper we propose a language extension that
              enhances the late binding capabilities of Haskell type classes,
              and provides more flexible means for type class instantiation.
              The latter is achieved via \emph{named instances}
              that do not participate in automatic context reduction,
              but can only be used for late binding.
              By combining this capability with the automatic aspects
              of the Haskell type class system,
              we arrive at an essentially conservative extension
              that greatly improves flexibility of programming
              using type classes and opens up new structuring principles
              for Haskell library design.
              
              We exemplify our extension
              through the sketch of some applications 
              and show how our approach could be used
              to explain or subsume other language features 
              as for example implicit parameters.
              We present a typed lambda-calculus for our extension
              and provide a working prototype type checker on the basis of 
              Mark Jones' ``Typing Haskell in Haskell''.}

  ABSTRACT     = "Mixin-Based Programming in C++ is a powerful
                  programming style based on the parameterized
                  inheritance idiom and the composition of C++
                  templates. Type expressions describing specific
                  inheritance hierarchies can be composed either
                  automatically using generative programming idioms in
                  C++ or manually. Unfortunately, the mixin-based C++
                  programming techniques published to date do not
                  adequately support optional and alternative mixin
                  classes with constructors expecting varying numbers
                  of arguments, which are common in practice. This is
                  because the varying base class constructors do not
                  provide a uniform interface on which the
                  constructors of the derived classes could rely. This
                  paper discusses several partial solutions to this
                  problem that were proposed to date and presents a
                  new, complete solution. The new solution uses
                  generative programming techniques to automatically
                  generate the appropriate constructors, and this way
                  it avoids the overhead and clumsiness of
                  instantiating composed mixin classes in the client
                  code using the partial solutions. In fact, the new
                  solution allows users to instantiate automatically
                  composed mixin classes with the simplicity of
                  instantiating concrete classes from traditional
                  class hierarchies. Finally, the new solution does
                  not suffer from the scalability problems of the
                  partial solutions."

  ABSTRACT     = "We present an extensible framework for defining and
                  using ``static interfaces'' in C++. Static
                  interfaces are especially useful as constraints on
                  template parameters. That is, in addition to the
                  usual template $class T$, template definitions can
                  specify that T ``isa'' Foo, for some static
                  interface named Foo. These ``isa-constraints'' can
                  be based on either inheritance (named conformance: T
                  publicly inherits Foo), members (structural
                  conformance: T has these member functions with these
                  signatures), or both. The constraint mechanism
                  imposes no space or time overheads at runtime;
                  virtual functions are conspicuously absent from our
                  framework. We demonstrate two key utilities of
                  static interfaces. First, constraints enable better
                  error messages with template code. By applying
                  static interfaces as constraints, instantiating a
                  template with the wrong type is an error that can be
                  caught at the instantiation point, rather than later
                  (typically in the bowels of the
                  implementation). Authors of template classes and
                  template functions can also dispatch ``custom error
                  messages'' to report named constraint violations by
                  clients, making debugging easier. We show examples
                  of the improvement of error messages when
                  constraints are applied to STL code. Second,
                  constraints enable automatic compile-time dispatch
                  of different implementations of class or function
                  templates based on the named conformance properties
                  of the template types. For example, $Set<T>$ can be
                  written to automatically choose the most efficient
                  implementation: use a hashtable implementation if
                  ``T isa Hashable'', or else a binary search tree if
                  ``T isa LessThanComparable'' , or else a linked-list
                  if merely ``T isa EqualityComparable''. This
                  dispatch can be completely hidden from clients of
                  Set, who just use $Set<T>$ as usual."

  ABSTRACT     = "Generic programming in C++ is characterized by the
                  use of template parameters to represent abstract
                  data types (or ``concepts''). However, the C++
                  language itself does not provide a mechanism for
                  explicitly handling concepts. As a result, it can be
                  difficult to insure that a concrete type meets the
                  requirements of the concept it is supposed to
                  represent. Error messages resulting from incorrect
                  use of a concrete type can be particularly difficult
                  to decipher. In this paper we present techniques to
                  check parameters in generic C++ libraries. Our
                  techniques use standard C++ and introduce no
                  run-time overhead."

                 functions with a template parameter type without
                 requiring that they be defined as members of the type.
                 A simple language extension dramatically (and
                 upward-compatibly) extends the technique to allow

We show, mostly through detailed examples, that
programming patterns known to involve the notion of virtual types can be
implemented in a real object-oriented language ---Ocaml--- in a direct way
by taking advantage of parametric classes and a flexible treatment of object
types via the use of row variables.  We also attempt to explain the
essence of virtual types.  Our \emph {free} solution to  virtual types seems
to be more general and often more flexible than \emph {ad hoc} solutions
that have been previously proposed.

  TITLE = {Compiling with Polymorphic and Polyvariant Flow
                  Types},
  CROSSREF = {TIC1997},
  ABSTRACT = {Optimizing compilers for function-oriented and
                  object-oriented languages exploit type and flow
                  information for efficient implementation. Although
                  type and flow information (both control and data
                  flow) are inseparably intertwined, compilers usually
                  compute and represent them separately. Partially,
                  this has been a result of the usual polymorphic type
                  systems using $\forall$ and $\exists$ quantifiers,
                  which are difficult to use in combination with flow
                  annotations. \par In the Church Project, we are
                  experimenting with intermediate languages that
                  integrate type and flow information into a single
                  {\em flow type} framework. This integration
                  facilitates the preservation of flow and type
                  information through program transformations. In this
                  paper we describe $\lambda^{\mathrm{CIL}}$, an
                  intermediate language supporting polymorphic types
                  and polyvariant flow information and describe its
                  application in program optimiziation. We are
                  experimenting with this intermediate language in a
                  flow and type-directed compiler for a functional
                  language. The types of $\lambda^{\mathrm{CIL}}$
                  encode flow information (1) via labels that
                  approximate sources and sinks of values and (2) via
                  intersection and union types, finitary versions of
                  universal and existential types that support type
                  polymorphism and (in combination with the labels)
                  polyvariant flow analysis. Accurate flow types
                  expose opportunities for a wide range of optimizing
                  program transformations.},

                  paradigm for developing libraries for
                  high-performance computing because it simultaneously
                  emphasizes generality and efficiency. In the generic
                  programming approach, interfaces are based on sets
                  of specified requirements on types, rather than on
                  any particular types, allowing algorithms to
                  inter-operate with any data types meeting the
                  necessary requirements. These sets of requirements,
                  known as concepts, can specify syntactic as well as
                  semantic requirements. Besides providing a powerful
                  means of describing interfaces to maximize software
                  reuse, concepts provide a uniform mechanism for more
                  closely coupling libraries with compilers and for
                  effecting domain-specific library-based compiler
                  extensions. To realize this goal however,
                  programming languages and their associated tools
                  must support concepts as first-class constructs. In
                  this paper we advocate better syntactic and semantic
                  support to make concepts first-class and present
                  results demonstrating the kinds of improvements that
                  are possible with static checking, compiler
                  optimization, and algorithm correctness proofs for
                  generic libraries based on concepts. },

   journal = {Software: Practice \& Experience},
   year = 2006,
   month = mar,
   annote = {Traditional static checking centers around finding bugs in
             programs by isolating cases where the language has
             been used incorrectly. These language-based checkers
             do not understand the semantics of software
             libraries, and therefore cannot be used to detect
             errors in the use of libraries. In this paper, we
             introduce STLlint, a program analysis we have
             implemented for the C++ Standard Template Library
             and similar, generic software libraries, and we
             present the general approach that underlies
             STLlint. We show that static checking of library
             semantics differs greatly from checking of language
             semantics, requiring new representations of program
             behavior and new algorithms. Major challenges
             include checking the use of generic algorithms, loop
             analysis for interfaces, and organizing behavioral
             specifications for extensibility.}

  annote =       {The past decade of experience has demonstrated that the generic
  programming methodology is highly effective for the design,
  implementation, and use of large-scale software libraries.
  The fundamental principle of generic programming is the realization
  of interfaces for entire sets of components, based on their
  essential syntactic and semantic requirements, rather than for any particular
  components.
  Many programming languages have features for describing interfaces
  between software components, but none completely support the
  approach used in generic programming.
  We have recently developed G, a language designed to provide
  first-class language support for generic programming and large-scale
  libraries.
  In this paper, we present an overview of G and analyze the
  interdependence between language features and libraries design 
  in light of a complete implementation of the Standard Template
  Library using G.
  In addition,
  we discuss important issues related to modularity and encapsulation
  in large-scale libraries and how language support for validation of
  components in isolation can prevent many common problems in
  component integration.

  ABSTRACT     = "This paper proposes an alternate structure for C++
                  compilers. Type analysis is removed from the
                  compiler and replaced with a `type system library'
                  which is treated as source code by the
                  compiler. Type computations are embedded in the
                  intermediate language of the compiler, and partial
                  evaluation is used to drive type analysis and
                  template instantiation. By making simple changes to
                  the behavior of the partial evaluator, a wide range
                  of compilation models is achieved, each with a
                  distinct tradeoff of compile time, code size, and
                  code speed. These models range from pure dynamic
                  typing -- ideal for scripting C++ -- to
                  profile-directed template instantiation. This
                  approach may solve several serious problems in
                  compiling C++: it achieves separate compilation of
                  templates, allows template code to be distributed in
                  binary form by deferring template instantiation
                  until run time, and reduces the code bloat
                  associated with templates."

                  interpreted by the compiler, which results in large
                  speed increases for many applications. A simple
                  example that generates factorials at compile time is
                  presented. Although this technique might seem like
                  just a cute C++ trick, it becomes powerful when
                  combined with normal C++ code. In this hybrid
                  approach, source code contains two programs: the
                  normal C++ runtime program, and a template
                  metaprogram that runs at compile time. Template
                  metaprograms can generate useful code when
                  interpreted by the compiler, such as a massively
                  inlined algorithm-that is, an implementation of an
                  algorithm that works for a specific input size, and
                  has its loops unrolled. This results in large speed

of generic programming. This point is of interest because it optimizes
modularity and safety, while still affording run-time efficiency.  We
focus on the interface of generic functions: how their type
requirements are described, the name lookup algorithm, and how
separate type checking and separate compilation are achieved.  The
design point presented is fairly close to the type class mechanism of
Haskell, though there are several alterations to improve modularity
and to accommodate common idioms that appear in C++ generic
libraries.

  annote = {The past decade of software library construction has
	    demonstrated that the discipline of generic programming is an
	    effective approach to the design and implementation of large-scale
	    software libraries.  At the heart of generic programming is a
	    semi-formal interface specification language for generic
	    components. Many programming languages have features for describing
	    interfaces, but none of them match the generic programming
	    specification language, and none are as suitable for specifying
	    generic components. This lack of language support impedes the current
	    practice of generic programming. In this dissertation I present and
	    evaluate the design of a new programming language, named G (for
	    generic), that integrates the generic programming specification
	    language with the type system and features of a full programming
	    language. The design of G is based on my experiences, and those of
	    colleagues, in the construction of generic libraries over the past
	    decade. The design space for programming languages is large, thus this
	    experience is vital in guiding choices among the many tradeoffs. The
	    design of G emphasizes modularity because generic programming is
	    inherently about composing separately developed components. In this
	    dissertation I demonstrate that the design is implementable by
	    constructing a compiler for G (translating to C++) and show the
	    suitability of G for generic programming with prototypes of the
	    Standard Template Library and the Boost Graph Library in G. I
	    formalize the essential features of G in a small language and prove
	    type soundness.}

Our algorithms require $2|V| â 2$ messages and units of time in the worst case, where $|V|$ is the number of sites in the network, and as little as $|V|$ messages and time units in the best case. The actual number of messages and time units depends on the network topology and possibly on the routing chosen. We can interpret this to mean that the number of messages and time units is $|V|(1 + r)$ in the worst case, where $0 \leq r < 1$ and the value of $r$ depends on the topology and the routing. In a best case for the simplest algorithm, for example when the underlying network has a ring topology, $r = 0$ and our basic algorithm requires $|V|$ messages and time units, regardless of routing. We extend the basic algorithm to achieve the same best case bound for other topologies. The worst case bound, which has $r = 1 â 2/|V|$, applies if the network topology is a tree. The improvement over the best of previous algorithms is achieved by dynamic backtracking, with a minor increase in message length.}

The sort-based approaches introduced sorts the tuples of the relation into topological order, and the sorted relation is then horizontally partitioned and distributed across several processing nodes of a message passing multiprocessor system. This data partitioning strategy allows the transitive closure computation of the local data fragments to be computed in parallel with no interprocessor communication. The construction of the final result then requires only a small number of joins. Extensive analytical results are included in the paper as well. They show that the proposed techniques leads to a speedup that is essentially linear with the number of processors. Its performance is significantly better than the recently published hashless parallel algorithm},

We concentrate on a variant of LogP that disallows the so-called stalling behavior, although issues surrounding the stalling phenomenon are also explored. Very efficient cross simulations between the two models are derived, showing their substantial equivalence for algorithmic design guided by asymptotic analysis. It is also shown that the two models can be implemented with similar performance on most point-to-point networks. In conclusion, within the limits of our analysis that is mainly of an asymptotic nature, BSP and (stall-free) LogP can be viewed as closely related variants within the bandwidth-latency framework for modeling parallel computation. BSP seems somewhat preferable due to its greater simplicity and portability, and slightly greater power. LogP lends itself more naturally to multiuser mode.}

Both kinds of models encourage exploitation of formal loopholes, rather than rewarding development of techniques that yield performance across a range of current and future parallel machines. This paper offers a new parallel machine model, called LogP, that reflects the critical technology trends underlying parallel computers. it is intended to serve as a basis for developing fast, portable parallel algorithms and to offer guidelines to machine designers. Such a model must strike a balance between detail and simplicity in order to reveal important bottlenecks without making analysis of interesting problems intractable. The model is based on four parameters that specify abstractly the computing bandwidth, the communication bandwidth, the communication delay, and the efficiency of coupling communication and computation. Portable parallel algorithms typically adapt to the machine configuration, in terms of these parameters. The utility of the model is demonstrated through examples that are implemented on the CM-5.},

  Graph Library (BGL) for parallel operation with distributed memory. The BGL
  is a library of generic graph algorithms and supporting data structures
  written in C++, but it was not originally designed with parallelism in mind.
  The generic programming process of lifting is illustrated using one of the
  core algorithms in the BGL--breadth-first search--abstracting away the
  implicit requirements of sequential execution and a single, shared address
  space. The resulting generic algorithm is completely unchanged from the
  sequential algorithm, requiring only the introduction of external
  (distributed) data structures for parallelization. More importantly, the
  generic implementation retains its interface and semantics, such that other
  distributed algorithms can be built upon it with no loss of efficiency. By
  characterizing these extensions as well as the extension process, we develop
  general principles and patterns for using (and reusing) generic
  high-performance parallel software libraries. We demonstrate that the
  resulting algorithm implementations are both efficient and scalable with
  performance results for several algorithms.},

            library for distributed graph computation. Like the
            sequential Boost Graph Library (BGL) upon which it
            is based, the Parallel BGL applies the paradigm of
            generic programming to the domain of graph
            computations. Emphasizing efficient generic
            algorithms and the use of concepts to specify the
            requirements on type parameters, the Parallel BGL
            also provides flexible supporting data structures
            such as distributed adjacency lists and external
            property maps. The generic programming approach
            simultaneously stresses flexibility and efficiency,
            resulting in a parallel graph library that can adapt
            to various data structures and communication models
            while retaining the efficiency of equivalent
            hand-coded programs. Performance data for selected
            algorithms are provided demonstrating the efficiency
            and scalability of the Parallel BGL.}
