GENERAL INFORMATION:
--------------------
PFunc, short for Parallel Functions, is a lightweight and portable library that
provides C and C++ APIs to express task parallelism on shared memory machines.
Some of highlights of PFunc are:

- Custom Priorities for tasks.
- Custom Scheduling for tasks.
- Task Groups for collective communication.  
- Nested Parallelism
- Generic 
- Open Source

Being designed using generic programming principles, PFunc allows users to
customize their run at compile-time without any performance penalties.
