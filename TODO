(2) Dense matrix-matrix multiply using recursion (divide-and-conquer).
(3) NQueens using recursion (divide-and-conquer).
(4) Fibonacci using recursion (divide-and-conquer).
(5) Dot-product using SPMD-style work division.
(6) Frequent itemset mining using Apriori algorithm (candidate generation).
(7) Demand-driven DAG execution.
(8) Cholesky factorization.
(9) Bounded buffer producer-consumer problem.
(10) Performance monitoring using PAPI.
(11) Pipelining in software using tasks.
(12) Merge, quick, and radix sort using recursion (divide-and-conquer).
(13) Stencil computation (Jacobi) using SPDM-style work division.
(14) Travelling salesperson problem using simulated annealing.
(15) Graph traversal.

Slides:
-------
(1) Overview of PFunc.
(2) Selecting the various features.
(3) Writing and executing a simple program.
(4) Writing your own scheduler and predicates.
(5) How to browse the code.

Code:
-----
(1) Atomic operations as C++ objects instead of C-style functions for 
primitive types such as char, short, int, long.
(2) Message passing among tasks using groups.
